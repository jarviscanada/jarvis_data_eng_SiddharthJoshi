This Project runs on command line and sends real time alerts via email whenever flights prices are low. It is really handy for me as I can get updates on price drops / low prices instead of checking everytime. Further enhancements in this project are yet to be made.",

The old legacy system of the blood donation department reeked of bugs and errors along with inconsistencies. This project enhanced the older system serving as a replacement with refined UI, robust database and smooth navigation. As a result, blood donation department operated more smoothly than before thus enhancing patient care and quality service to the patients.",

Being exposed with multiple technologies during my studies, I came to know its potential. I started experimenting and playing around with tech by building small projects such as 2D survival game in Godot Game Engine. After that, I participated in a project involving the replacement of the software in hospital's blood donation department. From time to time, I saw how the technology can be used to deliver values. This is where my true passion for Software Engineering was ignited. I have worked with wide array of technologies such as Java, Python, Django and relational databases. I have experience working in a team environment which I first gained by working at ABXR Engine, a startup dominating the AR industry where I worked on Python and Django. I am confident I can deliver values to your organization along with my technical acumen."
