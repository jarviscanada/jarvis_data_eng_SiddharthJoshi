    description: "This Project is a prototype designed for people who want real time updates of price drop in flight tickets. This Project is implemented in Python and its associated libraries. This Project runs on command line and sends real time alerts via email whenever flights prices are low. It is really handy for me as I can get updates on price drops / low prices instead of checking everytime. Further enhancements in this project are yet to be made."

The old legacy system of the blood donation department reeked of bugs and errors along with inconsistencies. This project enhanced the older system serving as a replacement with refined UI, robust database and smooth navigation. As a result, blood donation department operated more smoothly than before thus enhancing patient care and quality service to the patients."
